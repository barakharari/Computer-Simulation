# Computer-Simulation
Used Java to create a computer simulation with a GUI to display the computer running a program

Note:
.pasm files are meant to be assembled and .pexe files are meant to be executed. 

text.pasm, out.pasm, 100rt.pasm, 101rt.pasm, 102rt.pasm, 103rt.pasm, 104rt.pasm are not meant to assemble. All .pexe files with an 'e' in the end aren't meant to fully execute. These files have been placed to verify that error-checking is working in the computer simulation.
